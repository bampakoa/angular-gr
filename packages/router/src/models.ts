/**
 * A configuration object that defines a single route.
 * A set of routes are collected in a `Routes` array to define a `Router` configuration.
 * The router attempts to match segments of a given URL against each route,
 * using the configuration options defined in this object.
 *
 * Supports static, parameterized, redirect, and wildcard routes, as well as
 * custom route data and resolve methods.
 *
 * For detailed usage information, see the [Routing Guide](guide/router).
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * ### Simple Configuration
 *
 * The following route specifies that when navigating to, for example,
 * `/team/11/user/bob`, the router creates the 'Team' component
 * with the 'User' child component in it.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: 'team/:id',
 *  component: Team,
 *   children: [{
 *     path: 'user/:name',
 *     component: User
 *   }]
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Multiple Outlets
 *
 * The following route creates sibling components with multiple outlets.
 * When navigating to `/team/11(aux:chat/jim)`, the router creates the 'Team' component next to
 * the 'Chat' component. The 'Chat' component is placed into the 'aux' outlet.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: 'team/:id',
 *   component: Team
 * }, {
 *   path: 'chat/:user',
 *   component: Chat
 *   outlet: 'aux'
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Wild Cards
 *
 * The following route uses wild-card notation to specify a component
 * that is always instantiated regardless of where you navigate to.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: '**',
 *   component: WildcardComponent
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Redirects
 *
 * The following route uses the `redirectTo` property to ignore a segment of
 * a given URL when looking for a child path.
 *
 * When navigating to '/team/11/legacy/user/jim', the router changes the URL segment
 * '/team/11/legacy/user/jim' to '/team/11/user/jim', and then instantiates
 * the Team component with the User child component in it.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: 'team/:id',
 *   component: Team,
 *   children: [{
 *     path: 'legacy/user/:name',
 *     redirectTo: 'user/:name'
 *   }, {
 *     path: 'user/:name',
 *     component: User
 *   }]
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * The redirect path can be relative, as shown in this example, or absolute.
 * If we change the `redirectTo` value in the example to the absolute URL segment '/user/:name',
 * the result URL is also absolute, '/user/jim'.

 * ### Empty Path
 *
 * Empty-path route configurations can be used to instantiate components that do not 'consume'
 * any URL segments.
 *
 * In the following configuration, when navigating to
 * `/team/11`, the router instantiates the 'AllUsers' component.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: 'team/:id',
 *   component: Team,
 *   children: [{
 *     path: '',
 *     component: AllUsers
 *   }, {
 *     path: 'user/:name',
 *     component: User
 *   }]
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * Empty-path routes can have children. In the following example, when navigating
 * to `/team/11/user/jim`, the router instantiates the wrapper component with
 * the user component in it.
 *
 * Note that an empty path route inherits its parent's parameters and data.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: 'team/:id',
 *   component: Team,
 *   children: [{
 *     path: '',
 *     component: WrapperCmp,
 *     children: [{
 *       path: 'user/:name',
 *       component: User
 *     }]
 *   }]
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Matching Strategy
 *
 * The default path-match strategy is 'prefix', which means that the router
 * checks URL elements from the left to see if the URL matches a specified path.
 * For example, '/team/11/user' matches 'team/:id'.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: '',
 *   pathMatch: 'prefix', //default
 *   redirectTo: 'main'
 * }, {
 *   path: 'main',
 *   component: Main
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * You can specify the path-match strategy 'full' to make sure that the path
 * covers the whole unconsumed URL. It is important to do this when redirecting
 * empty-path routes. Otherwise, because an empty path is a prefix of any URL,
 * the router would apply the redirect even when navigating to the redirect destination,
 * creating an endless loop.
 *
 * In the following example, supplying the 'full' `pathMatch` strategy ensures
 * that the router applies the redirect if and only if navigating to '/'.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: '',
 *   pathMatch: 'full',
 *   redirectTo: 'main'
 * }, {
 *   path: 'main',
 *   component: Main
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Componentless Routes
 *
 * You can share parameters between sibling components.
 * For example, suppose that two sibling components should go next to each other,
 * and both of them require an ID parameter. You can accomplish this using a route
 * that does not specify a component at the top level.
 *
 * In the following example, 'MainChild' and 'AuxChild' are siblings.
 * When navigating to 'parent/10/(a//aux:b)', the route instantiates
 * the main child and aux child components next to each other.
 * For this to work, the application component must have the primary and aux outlets defined.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *    path: 'parent/:id',
 *    children: [
 *      { path: 'a', component: MainChild },
 *      { path: 'b', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }
 *    ]
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * The router merges the parameters, data, and resolve of the componentless
 * parent into the parameters, data, and resolve of the children.
 *
 * This is especially useful when child components are defined
 * with an empty path string, as in the following example.
 * With this configuration, navigating to '/parent/10' creates
 * the main child and aux components.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *    path: 'parent/:id',
 *    children: [
 *      { path: '', component: MainChild },
 *      { path: '', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }
 *    ]
 * }]
 * ```
 *
 * ### Lazy Loading
 *
 * Lazy loading speeds up application load time by splitting the application
 * into multiple bundles and loading them on demand.
 * To use lazy loading, provide the `loadChildren` property in the `Route` object,
 * instead of the `children` property.
 *
 * Given the following example route, the router will lazy load
 * the associated module on demand using the browser native import system.
 *
 * ```
 * [{
 *   path: 'lazy',
 *   loadChildren: () => import('./lazy-route/lazy.module').then(mod => mod.LazyModule),
 * }];
 * ```

 * ```
 * @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
 * export class HeroResolver implements Resolve<Hero> {
 *   constructor(private service: HeroService) {}
 *
 *   resolve(
 *     route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
 *     state: RouterStateSnapshot
 *   ): Observable<Hero>|Promise<Hero>|Hero {
 *     return this.service.getHero(route.paramMap.get('id'));
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Here, the defined `resolve()` function is provided as part of the `Route` object
 * in the router configuration:
 *
 * ```

 * @NgModule({
 *   imports: [
 *     RouterModule.forRoot([
 *       {
 *         path: 'detail/:id',
 *         component: HeroDetailComponent,
 *         resolve: {
 *           hero: HeroResolver
 *         }
 *       }
 *     ])
 *   ],
 *   exports: [RouterModule]
 * })
 * export class AppRoutingModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * You can alternatively provide an in-line function with the `resolve()` signature:
 *
 * ```
 * export const myHero: Hero = {
 *   // ...
 * }
 *
 * @NgModule({
 *   imports: [
 *     RouterModule.forRoot([
 *       {

 *         resolve: {
 *           hero: 'heroResolver'
 *         }
 *       }

 *   ],
 *   providers: [
 *     {
 *       provide: 'heroResolver',
 *       useValue: (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) => myHero
 *     }
 *   ]
 * })
 * export class AppModule {}
 * ```
 *
 * And you can access to your resolved data from `HeroComponent`:
 *
 * ```
 * @Component({
 *  selector: "app-hero",
 *  templateUrl: "hero.component.html",
 * })
 * export class HeroComponent {
 *
 *  constructor(private activatedRoute: ActivatedRoute) {}
 *
 *  ngOnInit() {
 *    this.activatedRoute.data.subscribe(({ hero }) => {
 *      // do something with your resolved data ...
 *    })
 *  }
 *
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * When both guard and resolvers are specified, the resolvers are not executed until
 * all guards have run and succeeded.
 * For example, consider the following route configuration:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *  path: 'base'
 *  canActivate: [BaseGuard],
 *  resolve: {data: BaseDataResolver}
 *  children: [
 *   {
 *     path: 'child',
 *     guards: [ChildGuard],
 *     component: ChildComponent,
 *     resolve: {childData: ChildDataResolver}
 *    }
 *  ]
 * }
 * ```
 * The order of execution is: BaseGuard, ChildGuard, BaseDataResolver, ChildDataResolver.

/**
 * @description
 *
 * Interface that a class can implement to be a guard deciding if children can be loaded.
 * If all guards return `true`, navigation continues. If any guard returns `false`,
 * navigation is cancelled. If any guard returns a `UrlTree`, current navigation
 * is cancelled and a new navigation starts to the `UrlTree` returned from the guard.
 *
 * The following example implements a `CanLoad` function that decides whether the
 * current user has permission to load requested child routes.
 *
 *
 * ```
 * class UserToken {}
 * class Permissions {
 *   canLoadChildren(user: UserToken, id: string, segments: UrlSegment[]): boolean {
 *     return true;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * @Injectable()
 * class CanLoadTeamSection implements CanLoad {
 *   constructor(private permissions: Permissions, private currentUser: UserToken) {}
 *
 *   canLoad(route: Route, segments: UrlSegment[]): Observable<boolean>|Promise<boolean>|boolean {
 *     return this.permissions.canLoadChildren(this.currentUser, route, segments);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Here, the defined guard function is provided as part of the `Route` object
 * in the router configuration:
